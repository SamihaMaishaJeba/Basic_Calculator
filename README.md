# Basic Calculator

This project is made for CSC-384 course using javafx and Scene builder. In scene, I used Anchor Pane, two Textfield, one label and one button .By pressing on button(calculate) we start calculating and connect it with our FXMLDocumentController.java file.




## Language

To run this project, you will need IDE like NetBeans to run this project:

`JAVA`
`JavaFx`




## Features

- It will take one string as an input. If the string is “id” then it will show my ID in the output.
- If it is a mathematical expression, then after doing the calculation it will provide us the output. It also follow the rules of precedence as (), \ , * , +, - .
- It can only work for int value expression. Otherwise, it will show output like “Enter valid expression”. but if the result double, then it will work properly.
- If there is any invalid expression it will show a message like- “Enter valid Expression". It will never crash.
